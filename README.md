## Optimizations

Improvements to this project would include faster responsiveness of what we do/about us section pop-ups (maybe incorporating React).

## Lessons Learned:

This was my first project that utilized Node.js as a server environment. While the project doesn't have a heavy back-end features, I was able to learn the basics of Node which allowed me to take on more difficult projects.
